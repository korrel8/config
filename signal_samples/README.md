# Signal sample data

A collection of observability signal samples in JSON format.

`samples/*.json` files: contain a series of JSON objects (not a JSON array, just the objects)
where each object represents a single instance of the given signal type.

## Accessing and generating data

Makefile: contains commands used to generate the data. `make help` for more.
You need to be logged in to an openshift cluster as kubeadmin, with openshift logging installed.

Samples are pulled from the current cluster so may not be representative of realistic cluster behavior.
They are useful to get a feel for the basic structure of the signal data.
